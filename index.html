<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>uicide is not an act, or apparent feat, which can be essentially understood in a person’s overcoming fear of physical pain.  I believe its main quality, all at once objective and precise, furthermore rarely named, is a person’s triumph over fear of loneliness.  It seems obvious, but it is by naming the quality of loneliness in an issue meaningful to humanity in its past and present, the timeless confrontation with the existence of the act of suicide, that I contend the slippery prejudices of modern day society towards the event of suicide.  While the ‘problem of suicide’ has unfailingly posed itself to each and every era of humankind, and invoked a multitude of distinguishing answers throughout history to an enduring question, it seems important to review the terms of our understanding of suicide today, to bring ourselves up to date on some common opinion around suicide proper, on what reality may be reflected with the exact terms we’ve come to on it, and what reality these terms fail.  </p>

<p>I have no qualifications or background to speak on this and related topics with any professional weight.  I can only rely on my own experiences, what capacity for reason and logic I currently possess to weigh and qualify my words, and stance regarding certain observations, experiences, as well as what I’ve made about the apparent experiences of other people I’ve known in my life.  It is thus that I’ve formed contentions, and attempt to persuade you of their plausibility. </p>
