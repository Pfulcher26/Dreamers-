<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>uicide is not an act, or apparent feat, which can be essentially understood in a person’s overcoming fear of physical pain.  I believe its main quality, all at once objective and precise, furthermore rarely named, is a person’s triumph over fear of loneliness.  It seems obvious, but it is by naming the quality of loneliness in an issue meaningful to humanity in its past and present, the timeless confrontation with the existence of the act of suicide, that I contend the slippery prejudices of modern day society towards the event of suicide.  While the ‘problem of suicide’ has unfailingly posed itself to each and every era of humankind, and invoked a multitude of distinguishing answers throughout history to an enduring question, it seems important to review the terms of our understanding of suicide today, to bring ourselves up to date on some common opinion around suicide proper, on what reality may be reflected with the exact terms we’ve come to on it, and what reality these terms fail.  </p>
<p>I have no qualifications or background to speak on this and related topics with any professional weight.  I can only rely on my own experiences, what capacity for reason and logic I currently possess to weigh and qualify my words, and stance regarding certain observations, experiences, as well as what I’ve made about the apparent experiences of other people I’ve known in my life.  It is thus that I’ve formed contentions, and attempt to persuade you of their plausibility. </p>
<br>
<p> <em>1. Loneliness (singularity) versus Solitude (duality), and ‘successful suicide’.</em></p>
<br>
<p>It is a logical obstacle for a person to appear all at once kind to himself, or peacefully 'with' oneself, while attempting any method of suicide expected to self-inflict severe pain and discomfort.  To that end, and to appropriate Hannah Arendt’s ideas on the distinction between solitude and loneliness, the full realization of such an inability to even be with oneself is the chief experience of the state of being one in an absolute singularity. Absolute singularity, in other words, unutterable loneliness, is what constitutes a state of horror and unreality. What is required to triumph this, and follow through with successful suicide, is the possession of invariable conviction, whether or not it also rightfully applies in a context of access to a ‘painless and peaceful’ exit, such as legally assisted suicide and euthenasia. This is integral to what Thomas Szasz, who has inspired me to pursue my own suspicions around current views on suicide, accepts within his definition of 'successful' suicide.  Suffering would need to be very great in order to maintain invariable conviction regarding death, particularly painful death, as a form of kindness to oneself. </p>
<br>
  <p> <em>2. The mark of the ‘unsuccessful suicide’, Doubt. </em></p>
<br>
<p>Most people, therefore, who wish to die, likely seek out the most painless and peaceful suicide available to them.  However, wherever peaceful suicide is not accessible results in greater tests of conviction.  While the failure of such a test may still potentially coincide with accidental tragedy and an otherwise ordinary lapse of thought succeeding (thoughtful) doubt, this doubt is the active mark of preventing thoughtless action.  Though suffering may appear incredible at any point in time, and the suicide may consequently appear to be in the interest of kindness, if there is any wavering of conviction, then there is doubt that one can be with oneself in the last moments of life. Following this mark of the 'unsuccessful' suicide’, namely doubt, it follows that the individual may potentially be motivated towards a desire for witnesses, but more realistically, and stepping away from the inescapably nightmarish quality of this scenario, still entrapped in the madness of an unutterable loneliness (and indeed, these situations will often elicit the most critical and entirely unsympathetic responses from others on the purported solipsistic selfishness of a suicide which has secured mere witness), it will, more importantly, motivate a desire, a day dream, and action requiring nothing more than simple utterance, to compel others to come forth with their company, with some form of kindness-- the continued and persistent hope for which seems to be the very cause of doubt.  This doubt is essentially reflexive, suggesting sympathy for oneself after all.  Doubt is, overall, an apparent inability not to be with oneself, as it is, by nature, a kind of dialogue with oneself, and seems to be the very cause of that continued hope for increased company.  </p>
<br>
  <p> <em>3. Psychiatry, prejudice, and common opinion. </em></p>
<br>
<p>You may at some point learn something about suicide through word of mouth - everyday talk within our daily lives.  We may all have heard something, at least once, or even a handful of times, about such an event. An example of an event involving someone else’s suicidal behavior involves alleged self-harm threats.  Self-harm threats are understood to occur in strenuous, long suffering, tragically formed, and dissolved relationships.  In such hearsay, one partner is depicted as uncompromisingly stating or threatening his/her desire to leave, and the other threatening suicide. These stories are made through gossip, diversely depicted in literature, films, and perhaps occur with less frequency in popular culture. While it remains logically uncontested that expressing fear of loneliness in suicide functions to gain control over others, an attempt to improve one’s life, as of yet not judged to be either moral or immoral, and which may be expressed in the form of a threat, it is unclear why it is moreover assumed in these stories that the ostensibly suicidal individual has acted through the explicit malingering of his/her own suicidal risk, and suffers from moral insanity.  If the issue relates directly to moral responsibility, in this case - to not attempt to compel others to comply with one’s own wishes through moral wrong, such as undue force and outright deception, if a man threatens to kill himself in the process of his wife leaving in order to prevent them from leaving, what evidence is there that suicidal risk has been feigned, or that this act is one of moral insanity?  </p>
<p>It is certain that suicide may be visceral and disturbing to others, but whatever means relating to the sheer visceral and disturbing nature of an act of suicide as it is likely to be received by others, do not yet point to a certain end. What equivalences can be made between the desire to end one’s life in moments of acute suffering and to express this by threat or otherwise, and a hypothetical scenario, which I will raise here for possible comparison, in which a person threatens to break his/her arm before someone in an attempt to manipulate their behavior?  We do not just as well regard the no less visceral impact of a loved one abruptly leaving or threatening to leave a marriage, with or without children, with or without financial support,  as equally disturbing and immediately unjustifiable, but as an autonomous choice- at least particularly in western society we do not readily typify and assign a spouse’s expressing their desire to leave with the immediate value of a morally insane threat.  So what is the exact value which the visceral impact of suicide has been assigned in western society, if it has not been equally assumed to be an autonomous choice, and solution regarding one’s own life and suffering, and not a conventional case of moral insanity?</p>
<p>So far, we know that the question of whether the individual did or did not genuinely feign and make use undue threats and coercion is not immediately answerable. We know that the question of their moral responsibility, much less the moral responsibility involving the one leaving or threatening to leave and apparently seeming to cause the other’s emotional distress, the plausibility of either’s actions and reactions in terms of moral responsibility-- never arises, and so, is never answered.  There is no investigation, or objective revision of this history.  Moral and immoral behavior is not weighed and justified to the benefit of objective truth and reality.  The only response to such conflicts, in fact, the predominant trend of this era, seems to be to summarily convert the suffering of the suicidal individual -- their instinctual response to some effect which was caused upon them, and the suicidal utterances subsequently produced -- to mental illness, very much like the ‘moral insanity’ implied in suddenly and inexplicably threatening to break one’s arm and subject another to a gruesome, disturbing and senseless, display as a means of control and coercion.  The crux of distinction is that it will be a situation apparently beyond understanding, namely evil; for a person’s capacity to take pleasure in harm for harm’s sake, to themselves, and to others. ‘The individual is mad, and irretrievably lost in madness.’</p>
<p>What remains is a curious glorification of the person who has meant to leave as deserving, and in full possession of his/her right to act on behalf of, and prioritization of their own mental health, an act of kindness to himself.  This goes on in the absence of any review of their own actions in relation to moral responsibility and propriety.  The assumption that any effective utilization of psychiatric language is exempt from any possibility of deception on their own part, permits that the situation must have been bad enough for someone to autonomously, in an absolute right frame or capacity of mind, seek out professional, psychiatric assistance; an unambiguous moral position. The difficulty with this privilege of action, which carries an air of incredible religiosity with it, as if the one who enters the church to absolve himself of his sins through confession first is the one who is most likely to have least sinned-- is when and for whom it applies to at any time, and who and what it ultimately serves in our society.  The difficulty here is that there is clear and explicit prejudice against suicide, and those who make themselves complicit in such behavior.  </p>
<p>A logical explanation for the complete and total omission of a real investigation into moral responsibility, is that the stereotype of the ‘suicidal malingerer’, on account of viscerally disturbing the other(s) with the possibility or threat of his/her self-inflicted death, falls moreover upon one end of a powerful binary of suicidal behavior as illness, on the one hand, and feigned illness on the other.  The colloquially automated estimation of any and all suicidal utterances as morally insane threats qua feigned illness, generally stems from a greater, more socially acceptable tendency to view all suicidal behavior as traceable to illness, by which I mean ‘mental illness’. Indeed, it so happens that feigned-illness may be categorized as illness all the same without any particular adherence to a code able to clearly divide the two. While motives for malingering range in likeness to those of Lucifer, the fallen angel, to Cain, etc, mental illness requires no particular motive, as the individual is assumed to possess no capacity of mind.  Both the suicidal, and  ostensibly suicidal individual is without question mentally disturbed.  It follows that the remedy for this hypothesis of illness and feigned illness alike, is viably pursued through an arsenal of more or less well-meaning deprivations of human rights, formally sanctioned by the psychiatric arm of the state.  </p>
<p>First, <em>mental illness</em>is legally administered to, using any form of psychiatric coercion including mobile prevention of suicidal risk, involuntary treatments and institutionalization.  It may still be the case that actually and physically claiming the other party to be 'ill' would not be particularly beneficial to the claimant(s) themselves.  It would, for example, be potentially disadvantageous, depending on the interests of claimant(s), to essentially lessen the responsibility of the other party through a status of medical mental illness, while inadvertently increasing their own.  This is why the ability to recruit parental or familial involvement and complicity in involuntary actions against both suicidal and ostensibly suicidal persons is so often crucial and routine for this particular path of psychiatric action. Otherwise, this predicament can be easily sidestepped through outright criminalization, alternatively viable through state law as forms of 'harassment' and 'emotional abuse' which may be pursued by criminal accusations claiming the other party has essentially committed a serious crime of feigning illness.  Fraud and deception as a means to unduly coerce and threaten the victim of such abuse into complying with his wishes can be charged.  Here, depending on the severity of the charges, the accused may also be curiously burdened with the responsibility of shouldering the pursuit of his/her own medical treatments, for himself, for the medical illness of general feigned illness.  This has the additional advantage, depending on circumstances, of transferring the status of medicalized recovery for any one-sided emotional abuses purportedly suffered, largely over to the side of the claimant, and negating any responsibility towards the object of these claims. </p>
<br>
  <p><em>4. The lost quality and action, and its widespread ramifications.</em></p>
<br>
<p>Referring back now to the first section of this writing, these psychiatric hypotheses of suicidal behavior which punish suicidal threats with unprecedented severity, the extreme options readily available to remedy such behaviors, even in comparison to the religiously motivated barring of persons who had committed suicide to heaven in the afterlife (refusing these proper burials, and sending them to hell), are notably remote from the fundamental wish, sprung from doubt of the plausibility of the suicidal act as a kindness to oneself, to compel others to come forth e.g. in recognition of acute loneliness, i.e. loss of reality.  Before any rightful moral judgements can and should be made regarding undue force and consent in undoubtedly complex interpersonal dynamics, it must be true and logical to believe that observable existences of acute loneliness in others can only serve to alienate an observer's own sense of reality, meaning that the feelings of sympathy towards such suffering are mutually beneficial.  This, if I understand correctly, is empathy and it is nothing short of a command that no one can sensibly be ‘excluded’ from plurality, a term appropriated to the best of my current knowledge for this writing from the work of  Hannah Arendt on her conception of plurality.  Doubt, the mark of unsuccessful suicide, which is then expressed to others, can prove to be helpfully echoed and then substantially reduced to the sounder experience of duality, in other words, solitude for the doubting individual, as opposed to loneliness. Investigation, reflection are both worthwhile as to why the individual came to suffer, and how he/she percieved acute deprivation of human company and loss of reality, or came to view suicide as a solution, or vice versa, just as a reflection on why an individual may have come to view the act of leaving a relationship as a solution, and how he came to suffer, to feel loneliness and loss of reality.  Psychiatry will continue to view the suicidal and ostensibly suicidal individual’s perceptions as the product of an innately flawed mind, while universally appropriating and then infantilizing, through patriarchal coercion and authority, such difficulties of interpersonal conflict and questions of moral responsibility overall.</p>
<p>But still, you ask, is it not possible that the sum of situations described thus far could be mutually inclusive? It seems to be the case that, hypothetically, people are capable of taking sheer, profound pleasure in harm for harm’s sake, in visceral and gruesome existences.  However, it is one thing to choose to live by this hypothesis of all behavior beyond immediate understanding, a hypothesis that states that we are only ever looking at a morally broken individual stemming also from a disturbed brain function, and this too often judged upon even those we have once loved and may still love-- it is another to recognize that empathetic habits miraculously disregard this view in favor of the other, disbelief.  Whatever (decidedly political) action that follows empathetic habits are conditioned by plurality, freedom, reasoning and common sense.  Prejudice, which arches over the psychiatric understanding of suicidal behavior and motive, habitually disregards the latter completely using common opinion, which, being once religious, is completely psychiatric in modern day.</p>
<p>The plight of individuals who have been subjected to coercive, fraudulent, demeaning, dehumanizing, and hurtful opinions and practices regarding both suicidal and ostensibly suicidal persons, opinions and practices which continue to draw these individuals as fundamentally disturbed, rather than simply, and understandably disturbing those around them in terms of perceived moral responsibility, must be recognized as a plight we all share.  Though it may yet be judged to be distinctly immoral behavior, it is not the case that it is a mark of illness or crime which can be ultimately settled by formal state sanctions and state power, except that this is exactly how society sees it. Though suicide may not be illegal, it is nevertheless illegal in practice because of ready and established means of controlling and preventing suicidal behavior through state sanctioned means of deception, which if it cannot be done in the name of unduly threatening and coercing suffering individuals into treatment, can be transferred with undue threats and coercion to the field of criminal justice. As Thomas Szasz notes, this categorization of suicide as fundamentally pointing to categories of the disturbed, morally insane, mentally ill or else criminal, leads to exacerbations of suffering in people.  It intensifies experiences and appearances of madness, continues to restrain individuals to states of unutterable loneliness, and the consequentially deep seated degradation of reality in our society.  Plurality is the condition of our reality.  It is in our doubting, dreaming persistence of it through all shifting forms, arrangements, negotiations and compromises, of the many customs and habits we so easily come to learn and unlearn.</p>
